## Hi there ğŸ‘‹
## ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on earning my Master's of Science in Graphic Information Technology. I have a background in Graphic Design. You can see examples of my previous work at: https://www.behance.net/busylis#. I am a stay at home mom/student. I also love animals and nature. I have collected 3 dogs and 2 cats in my travels and have lived in 4 states in the past 4 years but hope to settle down in Colorado.
