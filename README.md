## Hi there 👋
## 🔭 I’m currently working on earning my Master's of Science in Graphic Information Technology. I have a background in Graphic Design. You can see examples of my previous work at: https://www.behance.net/busylis#. I am a stay at home mom/student. ⚡ Fun fact: I also love animals and nature. I have collected 3 dogs and 2 cats in my travels and have lived in 4 states in the past 4 years but hope to settle down in Colorado. 

**eeierlea/eeierlea** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
